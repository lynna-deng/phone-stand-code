# Using Citizen-Submitted Photographs for 3D Scene Reconstruction

## Purpose
Camera systems with multiple angles ("stereo camera systems") allow for the 3D reconstruction of a photographed scene. One such stereo camera structure was built to monitor the Los Angeles River through community photographs. Community members place their phones in the system and take photographs for submission.

However, there may be discrepancies between a community member's photographs and the photographs used for calibration: Community members may be using other phone models, submissions may be incorrectly formatted (portrait vs. landscape)<sup>[1]</sup>, etc.

This code supports the automatic and manual alignment of photographs, aligning the submitted photos to a set of calibrated reference photos so that the submitted photos can be used for 3D reconstruction.

## Set-Up
1. Download and unzip the repository.
2. Run `stereoCam_main.m` in MATLAB 2023a to preview what a calibration looks like. 

Note that the system was designed for use with MATLAB version 2023a. Other versions of MATLAB may require alterations in the code for correct syntax.
